Pre-release notes for Multimedia Logic 1.6

Changed/added keyboard accelerators:
o Selector is now Escape. Escape still works to cancel editing device options.
o Switch is S without having to press Shift.
o Added accelerator "T" for drawing text.
o Added accelerator for Page Up and Page Down to navigate to the Previous and Next pages.
o Added accelerator "8" for the 8 Segement LED (A.K.A. 7 Segement LED).
o Set Color Wires to default to off.
o Added menu accelerator for toggling Color Wires
o Fixed bug where wires that were colored would remain colored upon turning colored wires off.
o Removed unused license code.
o Removed Menu item: Help, Using Help
o Added Menu item: Help, Contents
o Added Undo, Redo, Select All to popup menu
o fixed bisect wire bug where half the wire disappeared. If a wire is bisected too many times,
  Bad wires are attempted to be created which gives error message but does not crash. Should we
  protect the user against their trying to bisect a wire a ridiculous number of times?
o implemented ability to undo and redo Bisect Wire. Undo bisect wire can be slow if a large
  number of wires with closely spaced nodes are bisected at once. This is because the
  transaction is per wire bisected, not for all selected wires.
o Made Bisect Wire show disabled in menu when paused or running.
o added Bisect Wire accelerator (Ctrl+B) to menu
--possible TODO: add Bisect Wire to Palette, or should Bisect Wire not be in the Draw menu?
  Maybe better in Edit menu?

o Linked CHM file to Multimedia Logic project
o Added Help Topic for Analyze Tool
--TODO: complete implementation of Analyze Tool

o Changed behavior when simulation is running and user tries to close document or exit program.
  now it prompts if user wants to stop simulation and exit. Previously user had to close dialog
  box and manually stop simulation and then re-attempt closing document or exiting program.
--TODO: This is still buggy and either crashes or closes window but leaves mmlogic.exe running.

o Set default filter for opening memory file to *.TXT and *.BIN

   //TODO: Should we use m_iBinaryMode to dynamically set filter for drop down?
   //I am leaning toward making dropdown be "Memory Files (*.TXT;*.BIN)" followed by option for 
   //"All Files (*.*)"
   //We would then eliminate *.TXT and *.BIN as separate filter choices in the drop down.
   //
   //Is there any advantage to using the full path? Seems it would be better to use relative path.
   //this would benefit when sending zipped MMLogic project that has WAV, BMP, TXT etc files so receiver 
   //does not have to manually select file location since they most likely are using different directory structure.
--TODO: when the proper implementation above is decided upon, change filter for devices:
        Write File, Read File

--TODO:
Fix bug where accelerators disabled while running simulation but not while paused or in Draw mode
  o button accelerators on print preview dead including Tab, Enter,dirKeys, (ALT) P, N, T, I, C, Escape
     o Space works! Press close button no error but press X on print preview closes and gives
       error about simulator must be stopped before closing.
     o closing print preview with X when simulator not running also closes the current document.
  o Menu accelerators dead such as Ctrl-F Ctrl-P etc
  o Find works from menu but Tab, Enter, Escape all dead while running simulation

--TODO: I think it would be good to add option to Find/Replace text for doing case insensitive
        search. This would help user to find non-matching tags.

--TODO: Examples, tip file, and Release Notes text files are missing from project.
        (either include or consider moving their content to the help file)
--TODO: implement auto-close blank document when opening document.
--TODO: Add ability to draw lines at any angle.
--TODO: Rename project from TestMML to something else

===================
Need documentation:
  o How Find/Replace text works...in selected items, or entire project if nothing selected
  o Bisect wire
  o Color wires
  o Keyboard Accelerators
  o Change or remove documentation on Network Setup Basics?
