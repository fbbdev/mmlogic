<P>The Network Device is both an input and output device.  It allows you to connect your logic simulation to one or more other logic simulations (and some other TCP/IP socket based applications) over a network.</P>

<P>Rules:</P>
<UL>
<LI>When you wish the Network Device to initiate a connection, select "Make a Call to" and fill in to whom.</LI>

<LI>When you wish the Network Device to accept a connection, select "Listen for a Call".</LI>

<LI>You can have as many connections (Network Devices) as your Networking software will support.</LI>

<LI>Each Network Device must use a unique port.</LI>

<LI>The "Listen for a Call" machine must be running before the "Make a Call to" machine.</LI>

<LI>A single machine can "Listen for a Call" on one port and "Make a Call to" on another port.</LI>

<LI>A single machine can have multiple logic simulations running and communicate with one another.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Behavior:</P>

<P>Each time you start the simulator a call is made to the specified machine (or listened for) on the specified port.  Once a connection is made, the Icon will change from a grayed out remote computer to a colored one.  If the Icon reverts back to grayed, it indicates one of the remote machines has stopped their simulator or the network has failed.</P>

<P>When the clock input "C" changes from 0 to 1 the data on the inputs is written to the remote machine.</P>

<P>When data arrives from the remote machine the outputs will be driven with that data and the clock output "C" will change from 0 to 1.  On the following cycle the output clock "C" will transition back to 0 (it can be used as an edge trigger for another device).</P>

<P>If more than one byte of data arrives within a single simulation cycle, each byte will be queued to subsequent cycles in the order received.</P>
