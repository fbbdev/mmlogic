<P>The Signal Receiver Device is used to receive your signal from other locations (or pages) without using a wire.  It will be sent by a Signal Sender Device, of the same name, with no simulator delay; it will act as a solid wire.  A Signal Receiver Device may only be driven by one Signal Sender.  As many Signal Receiver Devices as you wish may be driven by one Signal Sender.  All Signal Sender/Receiver pairs must be uniquely named by you (checks will be performed when you start the simulator.  Signal names are case sensitive (e.g. "AA" will NOT match with "aa").</P>

<P>Behavior:</P>

<P>The Output of the Signal Receiver will fire with the state driven onto the input wire of the corresponding Signal Sender device, all within the same cycle.</P>
