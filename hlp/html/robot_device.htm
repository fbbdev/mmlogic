<P>The Robot device is a very basic machine.  You have to build the hardware to give it any intelligence.  It is also linked to the <A HREF="bitmap_device.htm">Bitmap Device</A>.  The Bitmap Device acts as the Robots "Playground" you must enable a Bitmap Device to be a Playground (see the properties of the Bitmap Device).</P>

<P>The Robot Bitmap name must be of the form ????0.BMP and the simulator will assume ????1.BMP up to ????15.BMP could exist. You do not need all 16 bitmaps.  You may link bitmaps to direction simply by driving the direction inputs with the same value as the low bits of the bitmaps inputs.</P>

<P>Example:</P>

<P>CAR0.BMP

<BR>CAR1.BMP

<BR>CAR2.BMP

<BR>CAR3.BMP</P>

<P>The Color Dark Yellow (Red=128, Green=128, Blue=0) is reserved as a transparent color.  Anywhere this color is used (in robot bitmaps only) it will show the "Playground" bitmap background through (i.e. robots do not have to be square you could have a donut shaped robot).</P>

<P>Rules:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Each bitmap should be the same size but is not required.</LI>

<LI>Bitmaps must be 16 color bitmaps.</LI>

<LI>It is best to draw the first from scratch and copy as a base for the rest.</LI>

<LI>You must have a Bitmap Device playground.</LI>

<LI>You can have up to 16 robots play in a playground.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Behavior (Common to all styles):</P>

<P>When the clock input "M" (move) changes from 0 to 1 the robot will perform the following:</P>

<P>The "Robot" is the driven one step in the direction specified by the D inputs.

<BR>A bitmap is displayed based on the B inputs.</P>

<P>IF D is 0 the robot moves East

<BR>IF D is 1 the robot moves West

<BR>IF D is 2 the robot moves South

<BR>IF D is 3 the robot moves North</P>

<P>IF the "Hotspot" moves off the "playground" E is 1

<BR>otherwise E is 0</P>

<P>When the robot changes direction it will "rotate" around the "Hotspot".

<BR>Each time the simulator starts the "Hotspot" will be placed at the "Initial Position" on the playground.</P>

<P>Each time the simulator starts the robots look for the "nearest" playground to play in.  Nearest means it will look on the same page as the robot is on then it will look on other pages.  Multiple robots can play on the same playground.  Multiple robots can be "stacked" on top of one another to combine capabilities (i.e. a robot that has 2 "eyes" and 2 "pens").</P>

<P>Behavior (Style Seeing):</P>

<P>The C outputs describe the Color under the "Hotspot" of the robot.</P>

<P>Behavior (Style Drawing):</P>

<P>IF P is 1 draw a dot at the "Hotspot" of color based on inputs C.

<BR>otherwise don’t draw.</P>
