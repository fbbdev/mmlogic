<P>Lets start with, what is a logic simulator?  A logic simulator is a high level simulation of a "digital" circuit, the kind used in a computer.  At this level of simulation we ignore the details of the "real world" such as power for circuits, how fast circuits are, ground signals, cost and etc.  These details are ignored so that you can deal directly with the logical aspect of the problem at hand.  In the "real world", when you’re ready to build your circuit you can worry about these details.  Here is a simple example of real world versus the logic simulated world.</P>

<P>The great thing about the MultiMedia Logic Simulator is you can use your logic circuit without building real hardware, in fact you can connect it to (interface it with) real hardware (such as your keyboard, speaker, sound card, robot or another Logic Simulator).</P>
