<P>The Signal Sender Device is used to send your signal to other locations (or pages) without using a wire.  It will be received by a Signal Receiver Device, of the same name, with no simulator delay; it will act as a solid wire.  All Signal Sender/Receiver pairs must be uniquely named by you (checks will be performed when you start the simulator).  To send a signal, without delay, to multiple pages, a Signal Sender may drive as many Signal Receivers as you wish.  Signal names are case sensitive (.e.g. "AA" will NOT match with "aa").</P>

<P>Behavior:</P>

<P>When the driving wire fires a state into the input of the Signal Sender, the Output wire of the corresponding Signal receiver will drive that same state, all within the same cycle.</P>
