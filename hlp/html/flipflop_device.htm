<P>The FlipFlop is the most primitive storage device (it remembers).  You can think of it as a memory that can only hold 1 bit of data (0 or 1).</P>

<P>Master Slaves are internally made up from 2 Storage cells rather than just one.  When the Clock is not asserted the transfer from the 1st stage to the 2nd is enabled.  The JK is considered a Master Slave FlipFlop.</P>

<P>When the "Edge Triggered" clock is enabled the inputs are read only when the clock transitions from the unasserted state to the asserted state.  Where as when the "Edge Triggered" clock is disabled (Level Sensitive) the inputs effect the device as long as the clock is in the asserted state.</P>

<P>Behavior: (Common to all non Master Slaves)</P>
